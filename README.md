# Find Palindromes
## Overview
This repository provides code and tests that implements an algorithm to find palindromes from tuple inputs. 

## Returns
The program will return any new palindrome that can be made by removing one element from a tuple. If no new palindrome can be found the program will return None.

## Stipulations
Any input of length one or two will return None.
Any non tuple input will return None.

## To run
Make sure you have python downloaded on your machine by running "python --version" in the terminal. Then run "python main.py (...)" with your desired inputs formatted as tuples.

**IMPORTANT** make sure your inputs are formatted as tuples. 

An example running statement would be "python main.py ('a','b','a') ('1','2','3','4','5') ('ab','1','2','1','ab')" to which the program would return: 

('a','a') 

None 

('ab','1','1','ab')

## To Run Tests 
Run "python main_test.py"
